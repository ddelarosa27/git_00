## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Alice was walking beside the White Knight in Looking Glass Land.

"You are sad." the Knight said in an anxious tone: "let me sing you a song to comfort you."

"Is it very long?" Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day.

"It's long." said the Knight, "but it's very, very beautiful. Everybody that hears me sing it -
either it brings tears to their eyes, or else -"

"Or else what?" said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright â€”  
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
